Scrapped the previous code, and we now have a working user database that is currently being hosted online via a free service.

Purchased a domain that will be available soon:

www.takea-hike.com

I will need help integrating this into the current main folder, since I'm not familiar with the current code. I would like to prioritize
the login activity in android studio, and once the user is logged in, they will then have access to the map activity.
