Watch out for runners and dogs.<br \/><br \/>Added by harryt: The trails in Walnut Creek park seem to be designed for you to create your own workout.  I haven't mapped the entire crisscrossed system I imagine there is 15 miles of of sweet singletrack with some doubletrack and one jeep road.<br \/><br \/>There is little sustained elevation gain, but when trying to create a challenging work out I've gained over 2400 ft.  Trailhead for the main system of trails is near the pool parking lot.  Cross the creek for more challenging sections.  Especially explore the southeast for a series of trails up and down the same ridge.  Don't miss two isolated sections of trail near the park entrance from Lamar Blvd. both to the right and left.  The trail to the right as you enter the park has several BMX style jumps (wear a helmet!).<br \/><br \/>I hope you have fun on this gem tucked into Northwest Austin!<br \/><br \/>Update 7\/26\/2014:  Log Loop is going to be closed for a while, (month or so) while they construct some bridges as part of the park renovation.

               "description":"The History of the EB&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>The idea for the annual Enchilada Buffet Ride started with a simple blog post in 2008 by one Austin Mountain Biker with the extreme urge to ride all the Parks in Austin in one day. The entire post from the Bike Mojo Forum site is below:&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>    It's been on the backburner for almost 2 years now. Last year we went as far as planning it and it fizzled out. This year I'm setting a day and am going to show up. If I am by myself then so be it. I've wanted to attempt this ride for a long time.&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>    What is the Enchilada Buffet? It will be a self supported ride taking in a sampling of many of the trails in Austin. The following is a very brief description of where I and hopefully others will ride:&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>     &lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>    &lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>    Hopefully there will be some interest, otherwise I'm bringing my I-pod. Let me know if you have any questions. Start training...NOW!&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>On a chilly October 4th Morning a handful a riders showed up and ate all the Mountain Bike Parks they could. Some finished the route some didn't... but the annual grass roots ride was born.&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>The EB challenge attracts more riders each year and we hope 2011 will be no different.&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>It's a great way to get a taste or a mouthful of all the Mountain Bike parks in Austin and also a great day in the saddle!&lt;br \/&gt;<br \/>So if you like to bike and awesome people... get your bike and camelback\/bottles ready and come RIDE!!",
