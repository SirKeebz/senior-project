It is one of the finest downhills in the Lake Tahoe region as well. It is a somewhat difficult one with over 3200' vertical feet of climbing involved, but once you get to the top it is all downhill! The descent from Tucker flat is a technical test piece followed by some fantastic single track riding down the Saxon Creek drainage. The trail combines expansive views, meadows, and forests into one special ride. The downhill is mostly all single track too and very technical in sections. Total riding distance on this ride is a little over 20 miles. You will want to take a full camel bag or two bike bottles.",
