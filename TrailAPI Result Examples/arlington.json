Following the blue arrows provides a great cross country experience with only nominal challenges and always a bypass for anything a beginner rider might find beyond their skills. The optional red trails (EKG, Roller Coaster, and Fun Town) offer significantly more challenging features. EKG in particular, is aptly named for the cardio workout you will endure while traversing it. Home to the River Legacy River Rats (join our Facebook page), this trail is very well maintained and uniquely located in a wilderness area located in the middle of the Dallas\/Fort Worth area. This trail is a popular skills builder but is also popular for more advanced riders looking for excellent cross country &quot;speed and flow&quot;. The advanced sections like EKG draw recreational and race oriented riders seeking a serious workout and training opportunity. Come out and check out this trail, I promise you will return time and again.",
